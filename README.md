This is [colorbrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) colors for the Carto. Useful
if you're doing choropleths and want cool, well thought-through colors,
or are colorblind, or you're just a art-deficient developer like myself.

This is a simple port from [the d3 project](https://github.com/mbostock/d3)'s
[CSS version](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/master/lib/colorbrewer/colorbrewer.css).
